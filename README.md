# Next Steps

You should have a basic understanding of how you can easily implement a template into your WordPress site. Below are some next step items to be on the lookout for.

## Custom fields

On our home page you see there are some content areas that are broken up by html. We could use a great plugin called `Advanced Custom Fields` and easily add fields to the dashboard that can take place of these content areas. Whenever you develop a WordPress site be sure to put the thought process of giving every available option for content to be updated in the admin area. This makes it easier for end users.

## Exploring more functions

Don't forget to browse through the [WordPress Function Reference](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference). It is loaded with a great number of functions that you could use in your theme development.

## Asset pipeline

Another thing that is worth noting is creating or using an asset pipeline as a great starting point for your project. An asset pipeline helps with javascript and css management and compiling. You could introduce sass for css and possibly have gulp or webpack run it for you. This would be a great option and give you a headstart for every project.
