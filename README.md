# Page Template

So remembering again that WordPress is blog first you have to set it up on the back end for a page to load first as the home page. If not then the blog is the home page and then you will access the pages through their urls.

## index.php

So if you have no other files then the `index.php` will be used as the page template for any pages that you have.

## page.php

So you would want to create a `page.php` file to theme any pages that are created in the admin area. So let's create a test page and see how our `page.php` will interact with this.
